# Library (not finished)
This is basically a 6 book library in which you can delete any book of your wish and both the HTML and the array that contains them. The reason why it is not finished are because I got plenty of things to learn yet and I really don't want to get stuck by a beginner project.

ALso, it was not posible for me to add an action listener to the buttom 'not read yet' since it is made in a for loop inside a function and I don't know the way to access to it outside the loop. 

Anyway, even though this project lacks of many aspects, I am somehow happy to being able to do this at least this far. I obviously won't do that with really serious projects :)
